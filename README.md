 ## Problem Statement -
 
 There are a lot of bachelors who are studying in universities and lives on a flat far away from home.  Most of them don’t know how to cook and are highly dependent on junk foods or order foods from some food delivery websites which are unhealthy as the order is made either from a restaurant or dhabas and we all know how bad it is to consume such foods on a daily or even on a weekly basis.  There arises the problem of limited options for healthy and homecooked foods.  Some of the bachelors tend to pay monthly for their daily foods from some dhabas which is again too expensive for them.  Also there is lack of transparency and trust in food delivery.  

 
 
 ## Solution -
 
  What if they are provided with “Ghar ka khaana”  while living far from home. Not a bad idea right? In a society where that bachelor lives or nearby his flat.  A lot of homechefs make homemade food.  What if just by staying at home and using their cooking skills they earn some money by selling it to those bachelors nearby her flat.  What if patients own a healthy lifestyle and can make their health better?
